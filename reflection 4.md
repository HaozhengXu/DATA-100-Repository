The first example from Geoff West’s reading is the example of companies and business. According to the reading: “Half of all the companies in any given cohort of US publicly traded companies disappear within ten years, and a scant few make it to fifty, let alone a hundred years.” In contrast, for cities, the scaling of cities can be measured by the number of jobs and businesses that comprise their economic landscape. The mortality rate of companies, which is also known as probability of dying, are attributed to acquisitions, mergers, and bankruptcies not only for the companies but also for the cities. Essentially, cities are representatives of large-scaled companies. According to the data presented by Dirk Helbing, the scaling component for companies is 0.9; while for cities, it is 0.85. In short, data science allows people to know how a city goes, and scaling allows us to research larger cities with the data of companies. 

Another example is that almost all social components are increasing returns to scales. To be more specific, the larger the city, the higher the wages, the greater the GDP, the more crime, the more cases of AIDS and flu. Consequently, it can be said that all social components are relative to each other: we may predict with 80 to 90 percent accuracy what the average wage is, how many patents it has, how long all the roads are, and how many AIDS cases are present with the knowledge of how big the city is. 

Finally, humans and animals’ living can also refer to scaling because of the difference in sizes among animals and human beings. Typically, we may speculate how much an animal can eat according to its size, which means if an animal has twice the size compared to humans, it would eat twice food compared to humans. However, due to metabolic rate of creatures, an animal twice the size of humans might not consume so much food as we expect. As a simple example, the living span of a creature cannot be scaled because there literally is not a clear relevance between an animal’s living span and its size.

By admitting the potential usage and power of Big Data, Geoff West states that we still need something more other than merely analyzing data. It is true that big data can indicate many information, but like I mentioned in the last paragraph, we should still recognize that big data does not always make sense (indicated by the example of life span and body size). As a result, Geoff West wants to claim that people should not blindly believe in big data and theories.



Regarding a theory relevant in the face of big data, the example of inter-disciplinary learning can be raised. Typically, when one study Physics, engineering, or even data science, one needs the knowledge of other subjects like Mathematics and Calculus. People should know that calculus theories or statistics knowledge can be used for data collection and serve for Big Data industry. In short, data needs the support of traditional theories to be meaningful and powerful.
