###### Reflection #3

Owen Barder defines development as a property of economic and social development itself. However, Amartya’s definition is a general process that increases people’s capability to choose and freedom. To extend the general view proposed by Amartya, Barder introduces that development is realized through complex adaptive people, industries, as well as developments.

The toaster program is that Thomas Thwaites wanted to make a toaster entirely from scratch. Eventually, his toaster was partial success since he could not gather rubber, which made his toast burnt into flames in 5 seconds. The program tells us that even creating a common object like toaster requires  numerous effort and time. The economy should be sufficiently sophisticated and rich to supply the different raw material and parts. The development is not an increase in output by an individual firm, it’s an emergence of a system of economic financial legal social and political institutions, firms, products, and technologies together makes citizens capable to live happily.

The economic models have been successful since it has been able to create a virtuous circle as long as one knows how much investment he needs. With the knowledge of how much investment is needed, one can calculate the amount of foreign aid that is needed to fill the gap; with the knowledge of how much money is needed, one can finance big infrastructures. It is successful also because it is used even today by some world banks to calculate financing gaps. The economic models reduce poverty, increase income, and increase access to clean water; we find that it should be an Endogenous characteristic itself within the social system itself that is the missing part of succeeding. 

Steve Jones is a famous evolutionary biologist. He first worked to make nozzle in soap powder making process. He took ten nozzles, randomly distort them, and see the result. He eventually succeeded in making an effective nozzle with a weird shape, which no one could have designed and no one could explain why this shape of nozzle is effective with the nature that the new nozzle is hundreds of times more efficient.

A complex adaptive system is that one has to try many different varieties and changes and see which ones work the best. Economists typically ignored the complexity of the system they are working on, but biologists and physicists have been studying complex adaptive systems. Essentially, a complex adaptive system is tat it is not linear systems, but complex non-linear systems. Features are that the consequences of mathematics of the ways adaptive agents interact with each other in a complex adaptive system. They are all impossible or difficult to predict in detail; one can predict the system roughly as a whole; there are patterns of the system which are not specifically linked to any individual agent within it the consciousness of the human brain; adaptive systems tend towards greater complexity.

Haile Sellasie was the last Emperor of Ethiopia whose domination was ended in 1975. The Emperor had all its citizens follow determined lifestyles that helps him reveal his absolute control over the whole nation. It is dangerous for people to tell the emperor about the poverty in countryside. Essentially, anything that could make the country develop is not accepted by the emperor, which shows the suppression of emergent systemic change.

The level of specific improvements often outperform design: refering to Steve Jones, who brought up a massive improvement to the soap powder production process. At the same time, since for adaptive complex systems, it is impossible to predict the results of each event, it is not possible to also predict engineering solutions. What we should do is harnessing evolutionary processes and avoid isomorphic mimicry. Isomorphic mimicry means a government creates a fancy industry without the core part of innovation and the ability to create ideas and profit to the nation.
