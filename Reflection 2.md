Reflection #2


“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.”
Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014) 

In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. 

How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement
how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? 
How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships? 
How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?



Big data, as claimed by Pob Kitchen, is one of the most significant factors that is pushing society to proceed. In Kitchen’s article, he points out a few benefits brought by big data to our world: from social science, researches, to interdisciplinary development of human beings. In the following paragraphs, I would be answering the questions raised in the prompt one by one.

First and foremost, big data serving enables the analysts that are measuring to get a wider range of information that could serve to a more comprehensive conclusion. Without big data, collection of information would still stay on polling or censuses, which could be far away from objective and mislead researchers. However, with the presence of big data, as pointed out by Blumenstock (Blumenstock, 2018), the author of our previous reflection, big data allows researchers to find people who are in urgent need of monetary aids through their use of mobile phones and access to electronic devices. Besides, banks and governments can locate citizens that are capable of paying for credits and avoid risks brought by poor clients. Back to the article today, Kitchen cites Dyche’s research where unnoticeable relationships between products are discovered by big data and contribute to enhanced profit rate. In short, big data allows researchers to measure the truth easily instead of measuring a distorted result, which in turn ends up with enhanced evidence that helps decision making.

Regarding big data’s contribution to interdisciplinary researches, as pointed out by Kitchen, big data propels the advancement of data-driven science, an evolved researching methodology that becomes a new paradigm of science. Kitchen’s example is that with big data’s capability to gather valuable and massive data, environmental systems, as an example, are benefited since big data allows for a more vivid simulation of the material world. Were it not big data, one could never imagine that ample information of the past is gathered to help one predict the future: like the way we conclude and estimate rainfall in certain places with massive information from the past. 

Furthermore, about data deluge that is in another article, the author introduces a new argument that correlation is enough. Previous models have been trying to conclude the causation of events, which are proven false nowadays. However, with the presence of correlation, massive data could guarantee that as long as there is a proven relationship, no matter what that is, helps generate valuable information. The article introduces an example of Google where it does not know why one page is better than another, but one just follows the absolutely correct result generated by data. From my perspective, data deluge enables people to put aside any boastful causations assumed by human beings but respect data correlation. Since humans are not objective compared with computers, it is better to believe in what computers tell us.

In conclusion, data science allows people to objectively understand events through cold and solid data, enhances people’s decision making abilities, and helps the society to thrive as a whole.
