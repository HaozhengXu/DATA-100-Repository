Data science has been one of the greatest inventions in the 21st century. With data science, humans are granted access to what we could never imagine in the past: predicting the population of a city in terms of the hospitals in the city, as presented in Geoff West’s reading; adaptive complex system introduced by Owen Barder; and Blumenstock’s idea that people’s phone call data may be used for analyzing their economic strength. Essentially, data science provides us with a brand new world where we are deciphering more secrets of the mother nature and human development.

First and foremost, I wish to talk about some of the obstacles I understand that stands ahead of data science. What people generally would reject data science is that they would typically state that data science deprives them of their freedom: with data science, one’s personal information, preferences, and even secrets are all revealed, which means who are granted the rights to see the data is essential. One thing that should never be challenged is humanity: one’s greed shall never be challenged. With the data telling everyone else’s secrets (and there might be some lucrative parts), how can one resist the temptation to use big data for unlawful purposes? As a result, I believe that data science, in a small scale for each individual, indeed provides people with convenience, but in exchange for one’s privacy. Think about it, our preferences revealed in Facebook chats and friend lists, depicts a rough “us” on the Internet, which means if someone gets our information, it is easy for him to spy on us, get close to us, and probably harm us. In short, one obstacle that concerns me is that big data benefits us but simultaneously potentially would risk us.

Another thing I would point out my prediction about the future developing direction of data science. Take the example of cars. It might be difficult, but if we can make regionally make all cars connected in one single web (like registering all cars in one city into a system) where all car drivers only need to tell the car where he is heading, the GPS drives the car to the destination. Also, because all cars are connected in a single web, they are able to avoid crashing upon each other. Essentially, my prediction is that data science makes the whole world more like a toy model where the order is established by computer and coding. However, I have to acknowledge that problems still arouse because had my prediction come true, data science will have a way more dominating status compared to even today. Without data science, it is already difficult for us to live, let alone the more technology-basing future.

In a nutshell, data science goes forward, technology goes forward, and human beings go forward. It is true that problems arouse as we develop, but problem-solving has always been the indication of why we live and has always been one of the main sources of our sense of accomplishment. Though I am concerned about future challenges regarding data science, I am still quite confident that data science will bring us to a brighter future.
